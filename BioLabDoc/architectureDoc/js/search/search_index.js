containers\n\nCreate .env file cp .env.example .env and replace existing env variables\n(mysql/mariadb/postgres connection params)\nInstall dependencies npm\nStart the app npm start (app will be exposed through the port 3000)\n\nInside Docker containers\nJust run already prepared bash script:\n$ ./initIt will setup the project for you (starting docker-compose stack, running migrations).\nThe NestJS app running in dev mode will be exposed on http://localhost (port 80)\nFor IDE autocompletion to work, run yarn on the host machine.\nTypeORM integrated\nTypeORM gives you possibility to use next db types:\nmysql, postgres, mariadb, sqlite, etc. Please look at docs for more details.\nThe docker-compose template uses mariadb.\nMigrations\nIf you don't work on a production-ready project you can always change DB_SYNC env variable to true so you can play with NestJS without the need to write actual migrations.\nsynchronize: true shouldn't be used in production - otherwise, you can lose production data.\nCreate Migration\nCreating new migration is relatively easy and you can use typeorm CLI for that. You can run this command to create new migration:\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn migration:create -n {CreateTableUsers}Migration file will be placed under src/migrations. For more details check the existing 1611484925515-CreateUsersTable.ts\nRun Migrations\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn migration:runRevert Migrations\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn migration:revertTest\n# unit tests\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:covEnvironment Configuration\nIntegrated Configuration Module so you can just inject ConfigService\nand read all environment variables from .env file, which is created automatically by the init script from .env.example.\nSwagger\nRESTful APIs you can describe with already integrated Swagger.\nTo see all available endpoints visit http://localhost/api/docs\nAuthentication - JWT\nAlready preconfigured JWT authentication.\nIt's suggested to change current password hashing to something more secure.\nYou can start use already working implementation of Login and Registration\nendpoints, just take a look at http://localhost/api/docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 Vivify Ideas\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
